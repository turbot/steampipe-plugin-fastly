  name,
  service_id,
  service_version,
  comment,
  created_at,
  updated_at
from
  fastly_service_domain;
```

```

| Item        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials | Fastly requires an [API Key](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens) and Service ID for all requests.                                                                                   |
| Permissions | The permission scope of API Keys is set by the Admin at the creation time of the API tokens.                                                                                                        |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single Fastly Installation.                                                                                                                                            |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `FASTLY_API_KEY` and `FASTLY_SERVICE_ID`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest fastly plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`) with a single connection named `fastly`:

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`:

```hcl
connection "fastly" {
  plugin = "fastly"

  # api_key - The fastly API token. Required.
  # Get your API token from Fastly https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_API_KEY environment variable.
  # api_key = "cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai"

  # service_id - Each connection represents a single service in Fastly. Required.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_SERVICE_ID environment variable.
  # service_id = "2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T"

  # base_url - The fastly base URL. By default plugin will use https://api.fastly.com. Optional.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_API_URL environment variable.
  # base_url = "https://api.fastly.com"

  # service_version - The fastly service version. By default, the plugin will use the active version of the provided service; if no active version is available, then the plugin will use the latest version. Optional.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_SERVICE_VERSION environment variable.
  # service_version = "1"
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use the standard Fastly environment variables to obtain credentials **only if the `api_key`,`service_id`, `base_url` and `service_version` are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export FASTLY_API_KEY=cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai
export FASTLY_SERVICE_ID=2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T
export FASTLY_API_URL=https://api.fastly.com
export FASTLY_SERVICE_VERSION=1
```
