# Fastly + Steampipe

[Fastly](https://fastly.com) provides an edge cloud platform, including content delivery network (CDN), image optimization, video and streaming, cloud security, and load balancing services.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List your Fastly domains:

```sql
select
  name,
  service_id,
  service_version,
  comment,
  created_at,
  updated_at
from
  fastly_service_domain;
```

```

| Item        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials | Fastly requires an [API Key](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens) and Service ID for all requests.                                                                                   |
| Permissions | The permission scope of API Keys is set by the Admin at the creation time of the API tokens.                                                                                                        |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single Fastly Installation.                                                                                                                                            |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `FASTLY_API_KEY` and `FASTLY_SERVICE_ID`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest fastly plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`) with a single connection named `fastly`:

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/fastly.spc`:

```hcl
connection "fastly" {
  plugin = "fastly"

  # api_key(required) - The fastly API Token.
  # Get your API token from Fastly https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_API_KEY environment variable.
  # api_key = "cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai"

  # service_id(required) - Each connection represents a single service in Fastly.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_SERVICE_ID environment variable.
  # service_id = "2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T"

  # base_url(optional) - The fastly base URL. By default plugin will use https://api.fastly.com.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_API_URL environment variable.
  # base_url = "https://api.fastly.com"

  # service_version(optional) - The fastly service version. By default, the plugin will use the active version of the provided service; if no active version is available, then the plugin will use the latest version.
  # Can also be set with the FASTLY_SERVICE_VERSION environment variable.
  # service_version = "1"
}
```

## Configuring Fastly Credentials

You may specify the API Key and Service ID to authenticate:

- `api_key`: The fastly API Token.
- `service_id`: The fastly Service ID.

```hcl
connection "fastly" {
  plugin     = "fastly"
  api_key    = "cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai"
  service_id = "2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T"
}
```

or you may specify the API Key, Service ID, Base URL and Service Version to authenticate:

- `api_key`: The fastly API Token.
- `service_id`: The fastly Service ID.
- `base_url`: The fastly base URL.
- `service_version`: The fastly Service version.

```hcl
connection "fastly" {
  plugin          = "fastly"
  api_key         = "cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai"
  service_id      = "2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T"
  base_url        = "https://api.fastly.com"
  service_version = "1"
}
```

or through environment variables

The Fastly plugin will use the Fastly environment variable to obtain credentials **only if the `FASTLY_API_KEY`,`FASTLY_SERVICE_ID`, `FASTLY_API_URL` and `FASTLY_SERVICE_VERSION` is not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export FASTLY_API_KEY="cj9nU-sMOgUmo7FxcZ48tJsofuiVUhai"
export FASTLY_SERVICE_ID="2ctACCWV5PmZGadiS7Ft5T"
export FASTLY_API_URL="https://api.fastly.com"
export FASTLY_SERVICE_VERSION="1"
```
